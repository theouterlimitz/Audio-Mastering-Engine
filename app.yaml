# app.yaml (Corrected for Flexible Environment Scaling)
# This configuration uses the App Engine Flexible Environment to run a custom
# Docker container, which is necessary for installing system dependencies like FFmpeg.

runtime: custom
env: flex

# Resource allocation for the flexible environment instances.
# These are good starting points for audio processing.
resources:
  cpu: 1
  memory_gb: 2
  disk_size_gb: 10
  
automatic_scaling:
  # The minimum number of instances for env:flex must be 1 or greater.

# This tells App Engine to ignore these files when creating the container image,
# which can speed up deployments.
