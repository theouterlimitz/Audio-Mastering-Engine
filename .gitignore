# Ignore the service account private key
sa-key.json

# Ignore Python virtual environments
venv/
env/

# Ignore Python cache files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

**Step 4: Re-Commit Your Safe Files**

Now we will create a new, clean commit. This commit will contain all of your wonderful code changes for the AI feature, but it will **not** include the `sa-key.json` file or the `.gitignore` file.

```bash
# Add the new .gitignore file to the commit
git add .gitignore

# Now, commit everything else that was staged
git commit -m "Feat: Implement Phase 1 of AI art generation"
```

**Step 5: Push the Clean Commit to GitHub**

Now, when you push, you are sending a commit that is clean of any secrets. It will succeed.

```bash
git push
```
